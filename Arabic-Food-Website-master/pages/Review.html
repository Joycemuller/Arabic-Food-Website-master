                <p class="comment">The chicken kebab was tender and flavorful, with a nice char on the outside.
                    The marinade had a good balance of spices and herbs, and the yogurt sauce was creamy and tangy.
                    The pita bread was soft and warm. It was a satisfying and delicious meal.</p>

                <p class="comment">I loved the rice kubba, which were crispy rice balls stuffed with minced meat and nuts.
                    They were seasoned well and had a rich and nutty taste. They were very filling and satisfying.</p>

                <p class="comment">The pasta bechamel was a creamy and cheesy casserole, with layers of pasta, 
                    minced meat, and bechamel sauce. It was baked until golden and bubbly, and had a nice crust on top.
                    The dish was rich and decadent, and had a lot of flavor. It was a perfect dish for a cold day.</p>

                <p class="comment">The koushari was a hearty and tasty dish, with a mix of rice, lentils, macaroni,
                    and fried onions. The tomato sauce that topped it was flavorful and spicy, and the vinegar and
                    garlic sauce added a zing. 
                    The dish was vegetarian, but it had a lot of protein and fiber. It was a great comfort food.</p>
